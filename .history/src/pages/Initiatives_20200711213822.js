                and allows you to enhance your project portfolio! Whether you're an aspiring Product Manager (PM) who just stumbled 
                on this field recently or a current PM who's well-versed in many areas of Product, this opportunity will allow you to sharpen 
                core business, technical, teamwork, and interpersonal with others in the community! ðŸ˜‡</InitiativeLeft>
            <Initiative title='Book Club'>From joining the Product Buds Book Club, we hope you will learn more about topics related but not limited to Product Management,
                Product Design, and Product Strategy. Your learning will be fostered through discussions about the books we read on the #bookclub Slack channel and virtual 
                discussion sessions among book club members via Zoom. </Initiative>
